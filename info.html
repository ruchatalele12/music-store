            A music store page is a perfect experiment for music lovers. To
            build this page, you must know the nitty-gritty of HTML5 and CSS3.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the music page, the first thing to do is to add an appropriate
            background image and write a short description of what you will find
            on this page. The header section of the page will contain different
            menus that list songs based on features like genre, year, singer,
            album, and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will have to include necessary buttons such as start, stop,
            rewind/forward, etc. Add relevant links and images for the
            collection of songs available. At the footer, you can include
            contact details, and links for registration, in-store purchases,
            subscription packages, and trial options.
